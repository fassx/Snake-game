# Snake Game

This Snake Game is an implementation based on the original code from GeeksforGeeks, authored by amnindersingh1414. The original code can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-game-in-python-using-pygame-module/).

## Introduction

This Snake Game is created using the Pygame module in Python. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating fruits to grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the boundaries of the window or the snake's own body.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to control the direction of the snake.
- The snake will continue moving in the specified direction until a different arrow key is pressed.
- The goal is to eat the red fruits to increase your score.
- Avoid collisions with the boundaries of the window and the snake's body, as this will end the game.

## Features

- **Score Display:** The game displays the current score at the top of the window.
- **Game Over:** When the snake collides with the boundaries or itself, the game ends, and the final score is displayed. After a brief pause, the program terminates.

## Dependencies

This game relies on the Pygame module. You can install it using the following command:
```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the Pygame module using the command mentioned above.
4. Run the Python script. Use "python snake_game.py" in console
